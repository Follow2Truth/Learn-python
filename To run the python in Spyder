To run certain lines of python, choose those lines, hit F9. And then it will show up the result in console

x=[1,3,4]
y=[3,4,6]
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(x,y)

So you can use the run button above to run the program. Or what you could do is in the ipython console, input run .py to run the program.

Some common unix command
ls-----show the folders under current directory
cd-----show the current working directory
run----To run the program
dir(module name)-----can get the names that module defined
